# classify_images_of_objects
Using Keras to classify images of objects
• With Keras, it's easy to create neural nets, but it's also easy to download test datasets. Let's try to use the CIFAR-10 (Canadian Institute For Advanced Research, https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar. html) dataset.
• It consists of 60,000 32x32 RGB images, divided into 10 classes of objects, namely:airplanes,automobiles,birds,cats,deers,dogs,frogs,horses,ships, and trucks.
